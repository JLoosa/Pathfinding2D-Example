# Pathfinding2D-Example
This project is an HTML/JS page for viewing and simulating well-known pathfinding algorithms.
It was originally part of my personal site, but I would like have the ability to commit to it separately, which is why it is being moved to its own repository.

This project is being built using the Model-View-Controller concept.
Although this was not the case at the start of the project, changes are being made to convert it to this form.
By looking at the source code, one can see that many of the elements and interactions feels like spaghetti.
This is due to the last change over to MVC.

It is my hope that, by the time this project is completed, I will develop a stronger understanding of the various
approaches to solving shortest-path problems and that I will also have developed a fun little program for people to
mess around with when they are bored.
