    <h3>
        NOTE: This program is still incomplete!<br>
        Although you can "draw" some terrain, there is still no way to mark the start or end and, as a result, there is no way to actually run the pathfinding algorithm.<br>
        The final problem is that, although the underlying data structures are in place, I have no had the time from my classes to devote to completing this project.
        As time becomes more available, I will dedicate more time to this project.
        My goal is to have at least two fun projects that display some technical know-how before the end of 2020.

        <p>
            To use this program simple select the type of tool you would like to paint/draw with (E.g. Roads) and draw on the canvas <br>
            When you are done drawing, place the starting and ending points for the Search algorithm you would like to test, and press run<br>
            If you would like to watch the algorithm scan in real-time, simply select the "Animated search" option!
