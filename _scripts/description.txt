With the ambition of eventually evolving this project to use a Model-View-Controller design pattern,
I am going to define three classes that are to be representative of each of these three components.

Model.js:
    Holds the internal representations of the 2D pathing plane. Should be able to support multiple types of tiles,
    with each tile having it's own color and pathing weight.

Renderer.js:
    This is the view of the program.

EventHandler:
    This is the controller
